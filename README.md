I redesigned Slime Rancher's UI, specifically the HUD and Corral Upgrade Menu., using Unity.

The target user profile is someone who isn't competitive and prioritizes visuals and design over efficiency.
The "bubbles" behind the Upgrades in the Corral Upgrade Menu is a placeholder for actual animation. The envisioned animation would be similar to Slime Rancher 2's.
The menu swap buttons, sliding notif box, and game exist buttons are also placeholders. These are for function while testing the UI's user experience and for easy travel between the two UI screens.

This build only works on Windows (sorry Mac users!).
